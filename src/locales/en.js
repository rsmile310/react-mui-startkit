  serge_letter: `WELCOME TO THE SAPIAN GROUP<br/><br/>My name is Serge Maurice Lobréau, and I am the CEO and Founder of the Sapian Group. I grew up in a different world than the one I live in now, and I am living proof that dedication and hard work are the only things that matter; skill has nothing to do with it. 
  I was born in Africa and raised in France and have spent my entire professional life working and traveling overseas. 
  I have visited over 100 countries that are considered economically or socially underdeveloped. Seeing and understanding this shifted my focus to injustices and financial inclusion to solve many situations I encountered or observed. I came up with a framework that would enable us to address each of these concerns in order to provide a comprehensive response to most challenges, be they economic, environmental, health or educational.<br/><br/> 
  The answer was the establishment of SAPIAN GROUP in 2012, a company that was able to finance all my businesses and thereby address some concerns by offering fewer goods and services. To empower humanity, I aim to introduce a new paradigm shift in society. I don't have a focus area; instead, I travel where I am needed and where there will be a significant profit to support other projects. 
  At SAPIAN GROUP, disruption is in our DNA and we will continue to strive for greatness for as long as humanity needs. Welcome to a new world!
  <br/><br/><br/>
  SERGE MAURICE LOBREAU`,

To create more economic freedom and provide financial services to the billions of people who do not have access to them.

  ozeety_blockchain_desc: `Today, virtually all types of economic exchange that take place outside of face to face cash transactions require the intervention of a trusted third party (in fact, it can be argued that even cash transactions require a trusted third party since governments guarantee the use of cash as legal tender). When we buy goods online, we trust a credit card company or bank to verify and process the payment. When we send money to friends or family, we rely on money service businesses to oversee the transaction. And when we want to esta-bify a property right, we rely on central authorities, including the government, to confirm our property rights. By verifying the identity of participants in a transaction, overseeing clearing and settlement, and keeping a record of exchanges, these intermediaries reduce uncertainty and enable exchange between parties who may have no reason to trust each other. In doing so, they expand the range of exchange possibilities and unlock the potential for growth. 
  <br/><br/>
  However, there are several reasons why we do not want to rely on third parties to perform these functions.The first, and most obvious, is the fees that intermediaries charge for their services, which can be quite high. For example, the average fee charged by a credit card company to a merchant for a single transaction is 2% (Value Penguin 2017), while the average fee for sending money is 7.4% (World Bank 2016). Relying on third parties can also be inefficient. This is particularly the case for cross-border financial transactions, which often require several intermediaries and take an average of 3-5 working days to clear. Relying on third parties also carries cybersecurity risks, as storing sensitive data on centralised servers creates a 'honeypot' for would-be hackers and a single point of failure. Finally, there may be good reason to question the extent to which the 'trusted third parties' we deal with are really trustworthy. Public confidence in financial institutions collapsed during the global financial crisis, 
  and it is perhaps no mere coincidence that the Bitcoin protocol, which aimed to provide an alternative to the formal financial system, was introduced in October 2008, just as the global financial crisis was setting in.`,
